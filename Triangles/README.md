This segment is my first attempt at setting up an 
OpenGL project. 
Device = Linux Desktop Intel
IDE = Code::Blocks
Compiler = g++

Note that on my computer I have GLEW and GLFW installed, 
and I generally followed both a video tutorial and a book
tutorial to get this far. 

These steps to get here are not going to be repeated until 
I break my computer again and have to reinstall from scratch.
